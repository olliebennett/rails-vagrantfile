# Rails Vagrantfile

Vagrantfile for Ruby on Rails (RoR) Applications

This is intended to be minimally invasive to the host machine, and has no dependencies other than [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) itself.

## Notes

This Vagrantfile is for creating RoR applications, not for use when developing Ruby on Rails itself (unlike [`rails/rails-dev-box`](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box)).
